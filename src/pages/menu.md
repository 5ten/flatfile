Peanuts and other food allergens are present at all Gottâ€™s Roadside locations. While we make every effort to keep these items separate and serve those with dietary restrictions, we cannot guarantee that our food and beverages will be free of the eight major allergens identified by the FDA.

Consuming raw or undercooked meats, poultry, seafood, shellfish or eggs may increase your risk of foodborne illness.
