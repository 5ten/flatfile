Gott’s Roadside was founded in 1999 in Saint Helena by brothers Joel and Duncan Gott. Gott’s California-inspired dishes and seasonal specials use locally sourced ingredients and purveyors such as Niman Ranch beef, Zoe’s bacon, Panorama Bakery breads, and Osprey Seafood. Gott's modern approach to American roadside classics has something for everyone including dishes like the California Burger with a fried egg, Zoe's bacon, and balsamic onions, Ahi Poke Crispy Tacos with sushi grade Ahi tuna, "A" B.L.T. with charred jalapeño mayo, Chicken Kale Caesar, and hand-spun organic shakes. <span class="hidden-from-mobile">Gott’s commitment to local sourcing also extends to the glass with a California-centric list of wines and beers, hand selected by Joel Gott, featuring regional favorites from Napa to San Diego. Nineteen years later, Gott's Roadside has expanded from its original Saint Helena location to include restaurants at San Francisco’s Ferry Building Marketplace, Napa’s Oxbow Public Market, Palo Alto’s Town & Country Village, Broadway Plaza Shopping Center in Walnut Creek, Bon Air in Marin, and a licensed location at San Francisco International Airport</span>
